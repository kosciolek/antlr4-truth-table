A quick project to check ANTLR out

[ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) is "a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.".

The parser/lexer rules can be found [here.](antlr/rules/TruthTables.g4)

Another interesting trick is integrating a service worker with Redux to (almost) seamlessly [offload heavy calculations.](front/src/store/slices/tables)
